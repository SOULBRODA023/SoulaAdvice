## My process
Honestly speaking this was my first time working with API's , I did alot of research on promises , though I don't have a full grasp of how it really works.

So I worked with the HTML and Css first before trying to write the script in Javscript, I basically worked with console to make sure things are working fine. 
so I started with a pseudocode first before writing the main code. Pseudo code have ways of making things quite understandable, simple and easy

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS



### What I learned

I learnt how to make use of APIs . I hope to work with them in the future to fully grasp the concept of working with API

### Continued development

I really like to focus on how to work more with APIs
